== Spring-Boot, Camel and EnMasse QuickStart

This quickstart demonstrates how to connect a Spring-Boot application to EnMasse (MaaS) and use JMS messaging between two Camel routes using Kubernetes or OpenShift.

In this example we will use two containers, one container to run as an EnMasse instance, and another as a client to the broker, where the Camel routes are running.

This quickstart requires EnMasse to have been deployed and running first. To install EnMasse into OpenShift or Kubernetes follow https://enmasse.io/documentation/master/openshift/#installing-messaging[documentation].

The application utilizes the Spring http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/ImportResource.html[`@ImportResource`] annotation to load a Camel Context definition via a _src/main/resources/spring/camel-context.xml_ file on the classpath.
